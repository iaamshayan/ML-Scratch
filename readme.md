## 🚀 What’s Inside

| Algorithm          | Folder               | Description                             |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 📈 Linear Regression | `LinearRegression/`   | Simple and multivariate regression models |
| 📈 Gradient Descent | `Gradient Descent /`   | Scratach code for Batch,Stochastic and miniRegressor |
| 🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors | `KNN/`               | Distance-based classification algorithm |
| 🧠 Neural Networks | `NeuralNetwork/`     | Feedforward NN using NumPy              |

> 📌 Each algorithm is implemented using only **NumPy** and **pure Python** — no ML libraries like Scikit-learn!
